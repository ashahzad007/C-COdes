Great! Here's a Micro Strategy that you can use to keep your skills sharp while still leveraging tools like ChatGPT:

🔥 Micro Strategy for Improving Skills while Using ChatGPT
Understand the Problem First (5-10 minutes)

Before jumping to the code, break down the problem into smaller pieces.

Think about the logic behind the task you're solving.

Sketch a rough plan on paper or mentally, even if it's just a rough idea.

Use ChatGPT for Syntax Help (5 minutes)

Once you're clear on the logic, ask ChatGPT for help with syntax (for example, how to define a class in C# or how to handle HTTP requests in Angular).

Copy the syntax, but don’t just paste it blindly.

Understand the Code (10-15 minutes)

Go through the code and try to understand every line.

Why is this particular keyword used? What is its purpose?

Break down the flow of the code and relate it to your own understanding of the logic.

Modify the Code (5 minutes)

Try changing the code a bit to make it your own.

Experiment with variations of the solution, e.g., try using different Angular directives or handling edge cases in C#.

This will help you internalize the logic and see how flexible the solution can be.

Re-create the Solution without ChatGPT (5-10 minutes)

After understanding the code, wait a few hours or the next day, and then try to re-create the solution from scratch.

This helps you retain the knowledge and avoid over-reliance on tools.

Refactor the Code (5-10 minutes)

Go through the code you've written and optimize it.

Look for places where you can improve performance or readability.

This is an essential practice to make sure you’re also improving your problem-solving skills, not just relying on ready-made solutions.

📅 Weekly Reflection
At the end of the week, review all the tasks you’ve worked on and the skills you’ve learned.

Identify areas where you struggled and consider learning those concepts more deeply.

It’s a great idea to keep a small notebook (physical or digital) where you jot down key learnings from each task, especially those concepts that were tricky but important.

This approach ensures you stay hands-on with the concepts and build your understanding while using tools like ChatGPT to fill in the gaps.

🚀 The Best Part:
By doing this consistently, your problem-solving abilities will grow exponentially. You'll know when to use ChatGPT for quick help and when to rely on your own knowledge.
